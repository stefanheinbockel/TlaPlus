# A Simple Train Siding Modeled in TLA+
In this project, I model a simple train siding and how two trains can pass each other on it. 
I start with a simple model in file 01_TrainSiding_StraightLine.tla. Then I improve it step by step until in file 09_TrainSiding_ConflictResolution.tla all errors are resolved.
