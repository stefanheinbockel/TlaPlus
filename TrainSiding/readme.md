# A Simple Train Siding Modeled in TLA+
In this project, I model a simple train siding and how two trains can pass each other on it. 
I start with a simple model in file *01_TrainSiding_StraightLine.tla*. Then I improve it step by step until in file *09_TrainSiding_ConflictResolution.tla* all errors are resolved.
